## üîß **Project Prompt: Object Recognition from Video Frames ‚Äì Mini Project**

### üß† **Objective:**
To build a system that extracts frames from short video clips, detects visible objects using image processing methods, and allows manual tagging for further analysis‚Äîsimulating real-world auditing processes used in automation and quality control.

---

### üìù **Step-by-Step Guide:**

### **Step 1: Define the Problem**
- Choose a goal: recognizing and tagging objects in short video clips.
- Decide what kind of objects you want to detect (e.g., boxes, bottles, tools).
- Keep your focus on short clips (10‚Äì20 seconds) to simulate industrial use cases.

---

### **Step 2: Prepare the Environment**
- Install a Python environment.
- Set up necessary libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, and optionally Matplotlib.
- Collect or record 2‚Äì3 short sample video clips to use in the project.

---

### **Step 3: Extract Video Frames**
- Break the video into image frames at fixed time intervals.
- Organize frames in a directory for easy access.
- Make sure each frame is clearly named and timestamped.

---

### **Step 4: Frame Analysis (Image Processing)**
- Convert frames to grayscale or apply filters to make objects stand out.
- Use edge detection or simple visual cues like color or shape.
- Identify key areas in the frame that may contain objects of interest.

---

### **Step 5: Object Detection (Basic)**
- Visually detect object outlines using basic techniques (e.g., contours).
- Mark bounding boxes or regions manually to highlight detected objects.
- Focus on precision: the goal is to simulate human-level accuracy.

---

### **Step 6: Manual Tagging**
- Review each frame and label the detected object(s) with tags (like ‚ÄúBox‚Äù, ‚ÄúBag‚Äù, etc.).
- Save this data in a structured format (CSV or JSON).
- Maintain consistent tagging criteria across all frames and videos.

---

### **Step 7: Store & Organize Results**
- Store your object data along with frame numbers, object types, and positions.
- Organize your results into a simple dataset for future review or evaluation.

---

### **Step 8: Analyze Your Work**
- Count how many times each object type appears across frames.
- Check your accuracy and consistency of tagging.
- Reflect on common challenges like blurry images, overlapping objects, etc.

---

### **Step 9: Document the Project**
- Write a brief report explaining:
  - Project overview
  - Tools used
  - Methodology
  - Observations and challenges
  - Final outcomes and possible improvements

---

### ‚úÖ **Optional Add-ons:**
- Build a simple UI to click and tag objects visually.
- Add automatic object detection using a pre-trained model.
- Try object tracking across multiple frames to simulate motion.
